;;; Commentary:

;; This package takes an org-mode tree and converts it into a
;; file that can be read into graphviz in order to visually show the
;; tree as a directed graph. Mail to <theodore.wiles@gmail.com> to discuss
;; features and additions. All suggestions are more than welcome.

;; The headings of the org-mode file are treated as node text in the resulting tree.
;; Org-mode heading tags are included in the resulting tree as additional cells
;; within the node.

;; The tags are color-coded to be consistent across the tree.

;; Tree interleaving is also possible by naming multiple org-mode headings
;; with the same heading.

;; NOTE: this requires the GRAPHVIZ software. This is installable on
;; windows using cygwin.

;; To install, add this code to your .emacs:
;; (load "org-mind-map.el")

;; If on linux, customize the values of org-mind-map/unflatten-command
;; and org-mind-map/dot-command to have the values corresponding to
;; the executables in your system.

;; Then, run "M-x org-mind-map/write"

;; The latest version is available at:
